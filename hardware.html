                * A motherboard can be defined as the main circuit board within a computer.
                <br/>
                * A motherboard contains all the connectors for attaching additional devices such as the memory and CPU to aid in its performance. 
                <br/>
                * Typically, the motherboard would contain the CPU, BIOS, memory, mass storage interfaces, serial and parallel ports and expansion slots.

                Microprocessors use just a couple, or even only one. This makes data transfer much faster.
